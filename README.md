# 🎫 Ticket Flow

1. Admin runs `/panel`
2. Users select a **ticket category**
3. Bot shows a **modal form** requesting:
   - Brief description
   - Feds URL
4. Ticket channel is created automatically
5. Staff are pinged
6. Staff replies trigger **DM notifications to the ticket owner**
7. `/close` generates a transcript and deletes the channel

---

# 🛑 Anti-Spam Protection

The bot prevents ticket abuse by:

- blocking multiple open tickets per user
- applying a **ticket creation cooldown**
- validating ticket ownership through the database

---

# 📩 User Notifications

When a **staff member replies** inside a ticket channel:

- The ticket owner receives a **DM notification**
- The DM includes a preview of the staff message

Users are **not notified for their own messages**.

---

# 🗄️ Database
